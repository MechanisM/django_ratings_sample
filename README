I built this as an example of using django-ratings combined with the jQuery
raty plugin to do quick & easy ratings of models.

Requirements

https://github.com/dcramer/django-ratings

Installation
============

You will need to add ``djangoratings`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``::

	INSTALLED_APPS = (
	    'django.contrib.admin',
	    'django.contrib.auth',
	    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
	    'django.contrib.sessions',
	    'djangoratings',
	)

Finally, run ``python manage.py syncdb`` in your application's directory to create the tables.
